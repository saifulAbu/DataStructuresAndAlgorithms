#0 log rules
log(a, b) => a is the base
l0g(a, b) = c then b = a ^ c

when doing recursive call's, it can happen that you are calling the same function again and again.

fibonacci number generator recursive method:
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

some methods will get called several times
                          f(n)
              f(n-1)              f(n-2)
          f(n-2)  f(n-3)      f(n-3)    f(n-4)

as we can see f(n) gets computed once, f(n-1) gets computed once, f(n-2) gets computed twice.
